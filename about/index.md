#### Dedicated to Dissent

Civil Dissident is dedicated to providing a logical and reasoned dissent to views of all kinds. Our core value is that we question our beliefs and the actions of those in power. After the 2016 popular election, supporters of the president-elect called for "unity" and condemned protestors. Regardless of which side is correct, we believe that protest is important because it drives debate. Attempts to silent protests are dangerous for free speech and for the integrity of democratic decisions. We want what is best for our country, and we believe that a constant debate is the only right way to determine the best path.

#### Dedicated to Fighting Falsehood

As part of our dissent, we seek to counteract the "fake news" epidemic and unfounded propaganda. These two factors see to be the chief catalysts of the hate-movements that are gaining strength in American politics and social spheres.

#### Team Humanity

Party politics are destructive. American politicians have always known this. George Washington ended his presidency with the famous address in which he railed against party politics. Thomas Jefferson wrote about the dangers of political factions developing in the new American system. We failed to heed these warnings, and now many people simply support their team without thinking. We want to convince people that elections are not about winning, but are about choosing the best people to hold political office. If we drop the "red-team-vs-blue-team" attitude as a country, we will make better decisions as a people.
