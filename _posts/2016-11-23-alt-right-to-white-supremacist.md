Multiple mainstream media outlets have allowed white supremacists to rebrand themselves as a legitimate political movement called the Alt-Right. In response, I created this tool: a chrome extension which finds the misleading term "Alt-Right" in the webpages you view with the more apt "White Supremacist."

The Alt-Right movement was part of the impetus for Trump's success. The group is a loosely connected group of white supremacists, nationalists, and anarchists. After Trump's election, they have become emboldened. Alt-Right groups and sympathizers have started acting more hateful and more openly emulating the Nazis. The media has allowed this rebranding, disguised as a move for "unity" or perhaps just to appease the president-elect.

The extension is now available at the [Chrome Web Store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alt-right-corrector/fifhmohjhfljimehlklobbgbkhpgcnen)
